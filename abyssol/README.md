# This document outlines the design of the neuron networks

features:
- complex but high speed computing
- consists of three parts: synapses dendritic tree and soma

A synapse:
- dendritic compartment which the synapse is attached to
- variable weight that is constantly pdated during runtime to reflect the 3 rules for signal strength
- intensity and time of the spikes from the connected neuron
- strength of connection

A soma:
